# Predicting premier league game outcomes

My goal of this project is to most accurately predict any one Premier League game's outcomes in a season. I am personally a big fan of the English Premier League and will find modeling Premier League data very interesting. Although the results of the models I will complete will not lead to any 'ground breaking' research, the project as a whole will still serve as a terrific experience for myself to practice applying supervised machine learning models to different types of data. Upon completion of this project, I hope to have gained a better understanding of the entire end to end data science project process as well as to master using the three supervised learning models.

Since I will be attempting to predict the outcome of the game (either a W, D, or L) my task is a classification problem. I will attempt to apply three supervised learning models: multiple linear regression, decision tree classifier, and Adaboost classification models.

Dataset from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/iliaskydyraliev/premier-league-2022-2023-winner-prediction/notebook

The data is from 2017 -> 2022 and contains the following predictors:

## Main stats

xG - expected goals

xGA - expected allowed goals

Poss - possession of the ball

GF - goals scored

GA - goals allowed

## Shooting stats

"Sh" - total number of shots

"SoT" - shots on target

"Dist" - average distance in yards from goal of all shots taken

"FK" - shots from free kicks

"PK" - penalty kicks made

"PKatt" - penalty kicks attempted
